        <h2 id="share-info">How we share the information we collect</h2>

        <p>We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:</p>

        <h3>Sharing with other services</h3>

        <p>If you connect your Logmate account to any Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally
            that Logmate automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service,
            including your Location. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on the
            Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. See section XXXX below to learn how you
            can disable sharing of information on Other Integrated Services.</p>

        <p>In order to connect to a third party service, you will be prompted to enter your access credentials for
            that third party service. Logmate may store your username and an access token or similar credentials
            obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on
            that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.</p>

        <p>You understand and agree that other third parties' use of information they collect from you is governed
            by their privacy policies, and Logmate's use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Sharing with Third Party Applications</h3>

        <p>To personalise your experience, we may share some information we have collected about you with providers
            of Third Party Applications, such as high-level geographic information, your work-time habits including
            vehicle types driven and technical data. However, we take precautions to prohibit Third Party
            Application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information we provide to them or by
            collection additional information without your consent.</p>

        <p>Please note that if you:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Actively choose to provide Third Party Applications with additional information, such as by visiting
                a Third Party Application (which enables collection of your IP address); or
            </li>
            <li>Consent to collection of additional information about you by a Third Party Application provider when
                you for example register with or log in to the Third Party Application,
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The Third Party Application may be able to identify you and associate the information perviously provided
            by Logmate with you. You agree and understand that a Third Party Application provider's privacy policy
            governs its use of your information that we provide to it or that it collects from you.</p>

        <h3>Service providers and others</h3>
        We may, from time to time, share your information with other companies in the Tierra Technologies group, as
        well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform
        functions and process user data on our behalf, consistent with the "How we Use the Information we Collect"
        section above. Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and
        confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

        <h3>Other sharing</h3>

        <p>In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited
            purposes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>To allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;</li>
            <li>To respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is
                necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety
                of any person; to protect the rights and property of Logmate, including to enforce the Terms and
                Conditions of Use and Mobile Terms; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
            </li>
            <li>To allow other companies in the Tierra Technologies Group to use your information as specified in
                this Privacy Policy;
            </li>
            <li>To inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available
                through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not
                reveal your identity; and
            </li>
            <li>If you expressly opt in to such sharing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You understand and agree that the Privacy Policies of third parties will govern all use of information
            that we provide to them under this section.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your passwords protect your user account, so you
            should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your mobile device, computer and browser, and
            sign off after having used the Logmate Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no
            security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any
            time.</p>

        <p>We have employed a number of steps to ensure that all 'sensitive data' is encrypted when stored, so that
            in the event of a breach, your identity is not jeopardised.</p>

        <h2>Accessing and updating user information</h2>

        <p>You can access and amend some of the information we keep on you through your settings. To learn more
            about the information we store about you, e-mail privacy@logmate.co.nz. We will respond within a
            reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity.</p>
