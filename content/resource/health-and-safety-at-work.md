# Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA)

Below are some snippets from the HSWA that apply to all **Transport
Business Operators** whom _employ_ and/or _facilitate_ work _to_ or
_for_.

In short; if you or your company holds a **Transport Service License**
(TSL), and engages **Drivers** to carry our work then you are subject to
this legislation.

Failure to comply can result in significant
[Fines and Penalties]({{< ref "/resource/fines-and-penalties.md" >}}).

## Key items of interest


### Primary duty of care

> A **Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU)** has the
> _primary duty of care_ - the primary responsibility for people's
> health and safety at work. It must ensure, so far as if reasonably
> practicable, the health and safety of:
>
> - its workers
> - any other workers it influences or directs
>
> The _PCBU_ must also look after other people who could be put at risk
> by its work, for example, customers, visitors, children and young
> people, or the general public


### Due diligence

> Taking reasonable steps to ensure the business has available for use,
> and uses, appropriate resources and processes to eliminate or minimise
> risks to health and safety

### Overlapping duties

> When two of more businesses operate together, for example at the same location or in a contracting arrangement, they must work together to fulfil their primary duties of care.
>
> A business cannot contract out its duties. However, reasonable arrangements can be made with the other business to fulfil its duty, taking into account the level of influence or control each has over the overlapping work.
