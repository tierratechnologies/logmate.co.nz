# Drivers logbook

- I want to ensure I don't exceed the work-time limits
- I want to reduce the risk of incurring a fine due to inelligble hand-writing
- I want to simply the admin associated with keeping a logbook and providing copies to those that I drive for
- I want to ensure I can't loose my logbook
- I want to be informed when I need to take a break as required by the work-time and logbook rules
- I want to be informed when I need to take a day-off as required by the work-time and logbook rules
- I drive a mix of vehicles and want to ensure I'm calculating the work-time limits correctly
- I don't just drive for a living and want to ensure I keep an accurate logbook that reflects my total work-time
- I just don't want to use a paper logbook

If any of the above reasons resonate, then you should give _logmate_ a try.
