# Drivers logbook

Available on both iOS and Android phones, _logmate_ is an easy-to-use Electronic Work-time diary for all commercial drivers.

If you drive a mix of Vehicle types e.g. SPSV, LPSV, CRANE, HEAVY, etc. no problem; _logmate_ has you covered.

## How it works ?

Operating _logmate_ is pretty straight forward once you are familiar with a couple of new concepts.

### 1. Clock In; Work; then Clock Out

Unlike a _Paper logbook_, _logmate_ differentiates between 'Time at work' (On Duty) and 'Time not at work' (Off Duty).

Drivers need to _Clocks In_ at the beginning of a Work Shift, create the entries that reflect their _Work day_ in their logboook, then _Clock Out_.

Below is a _timeline_ of an example _Work Shift_ to demonstrate:
