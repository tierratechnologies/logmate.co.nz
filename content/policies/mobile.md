# Mobile policy

Effective 1 June 2014

Hello, these are our Mobile Terms and Conditions of Use (**“Mobile Terms”**).

By using the Mobile Service, you accept and agree to be bound by these Mobile Terms, the Terms and Conditions of Use (**“Terms”**), and the Privacy Policy (together, the **“Agreements”**). Your continued use of the Mobile Service is conditioned upon your compliance with the Mobile Terms. Unless otherwise stated, any defined terms used in these Mobile Terms have the same meaning given to them in the Terms.

## Accessing the Mobile Service

The first time you accept these Mobile Terms and access the Mobile Service, you will be with a FREE Trial of the Service. You understand and agree that Logmate has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Mobile Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Mobile Service.

## Data Security on the Mobile Service

We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password and pin protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong password/pin, limit access to your mobile device and sign off after having used the Logmate Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.

We have employed a number of steps to ensure that all 'sensitive data' is secure.

1.  Pin: You will be asked to create a 4-digit pin, for quick access to the Logmate Service, we will encrypt this pin number so that in the event of a breach, your access credentials are not jeopardised. You will need to change your 4-digit pin regularly. You will be asked to reset it anytime the current pin has not been used within 24 hours (for example at the start of each work week when you have not used your pin to log-in over the weekend period).
2.  On Device Storage: Logmate will only store your 20 most recent Work time records on your Device. If at any stage a new user logs in on your Device, this data is deleted from the Device. (ie. all historic data will be deleted from a device in the event of a full log in being cancelled). Personal details, such as your full name, email-address, date of birth, drivers license number/version/expiry and mobile phone number are stored locally and potentially accessible. At no stage are any payment or credit card details stored on the device.
3.  Access to the Data Services: Logmate employs OAuth2 authentication protocols which achieve secure ongoing access to the Logmate Data services by way of a token. This token has a limited validity period of 12 hrs, and can only be extended with the successful provision of your User credentials.

## Entire agreement

These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Logmate and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to Logmate are void. You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by Logmate that are not contained in the Agreements.

Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Logmate Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Logmate Community for customer support or access or free or discounted Trials. You will agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances, which are listed in full on the Logmate website. Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of the Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements. To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in the Agreements.

Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys (“Special Promotions”) through the Logmate Service. Special Promotions may be governed by terms and conditions that are separate from the Agreements. If the provisions of a Special Promotion’s terms and conditions conflict with the Agreements, those separate terms and conditions shall prevail.
