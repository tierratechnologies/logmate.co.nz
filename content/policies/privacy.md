under [The Land Transport Act 1998 (“The Act”)](www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1998/0110/latest/DLM433613.html) to
provide records to enforcement officers when demanded, as outlined
in [section 30ZD](www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1998/0110/latest/link.aspx?search=sw_096be8ed80df60cc_30ZD_25_se&p=1&id=DLM434624)

The provision of a Drivers work-time history is the responsibility of the Driver. At no time will Logmate provide access
to your work-time records without your written permission to do so. However, we may disclose personal information, in
response to properly made requests, for the purpose of the prevention and detection of crime, and the apprehension or
prosecution of offenders. We also disclose information when required to do so by law, for example under a Court Order,
or in response to properly made demands under powers contained in the applicable legislation.

control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. Please read their Privacy Policies to

accounts), so we recommend you use a unique and strong password, limit access to your mobile device, computer and
browser, and sign off after having used the Logmate Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no
security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.

We have employed a number of steps to ensure that all _‘sensitive data’_ is encrypted when stored, so that in the event
of a breach, your identity is not jeopardised.

## Retention of information

The length of time we keep your personal information depends on what it is and whether we have an ongoing business need
to retain it (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal
requirements).

We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil our obligations to your, to protect our legal
interests, to comply with a law or as otherwise stated when we collect your information. Following that period, we will
make sure it is deleted or anonymized.
