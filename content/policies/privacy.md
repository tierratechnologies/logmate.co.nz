<p>We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:</p>

<h3>Sharing with other services</h3>

<p>If you connect your Logmate account to any Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally
    that Logmate automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service,
    including your Location. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on the
    Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. See section XXXX below to learn how you
    can disable sharing of information on Other Integrated Services.</p>

<p>In order to connect to a third party service, you will be prompted to enter your access credentials for
    that third party service. Logmate may store your username and an access token or similar credentials
    obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on
    that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that other third parties' use of information they collect from you is governed
    by their privacy policies, and Logmate's use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Sharing with Third Party Applications</h3>

<p>To personalise your experience, we may share some information we have collected about you with providers
    of Third Party Applications, such as high-level geographic information, your work-time habits including
    vehicle types driven and technical data. However, we take precautions to prohibit Third Party
    Application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information we provide to them or by
    collection additional information without your consent.</p>

<p>Please note that if you:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Actively choose to provide Third Party Applications with additional information, such as by visiting
        a Third Party Application (which enables collection of your IP address); or
    </li>
    <li>Consent to collection of additional information about you by a Third Party Application provider when
        you for example register with or log in to the Third Party Application,
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The Third Party Application may be able to identify you and associate the information perviously provided
    by Logmate with you. You agree and understand that a Third Party Application provider's privacy policy
    governs its use of your information that we provide to it or that it collects from you.</p>

<h3>Service providers and others</h3>
We may, from time to time, share your information with other companies in the Tierra Technologies group, as
well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform
functions and process user data on our behalf, consistent with the "How we Use the Information we Collect"
section above. Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and
confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

<h3>Other sharing</h3>

<p>In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited
    purposes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;</li>
    <li>To respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is
        necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety
        of any person; to protect the rights and property of Logmate, including to enforce the Terms and
        Conditions of Use and Mobile Terms; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
    </li>
    <li>To allow other companies in the Tierra Technologies Group to use your information as specified in
        this Privacy Policy;
    </li>
    <li>To inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available
        through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not
        reveal your identity; and
    </li>
    <li>If you expressly opt in to such sharing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You understand and agree that the Privacy Policies of third parties will govern all use of information
    that we provide to them under this section.</p>

<h2 class="title is-2">General Duty of Proof</h2>

    security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any
    time.</p>
