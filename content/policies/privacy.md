See section *Sharing with Third Party Services* below to learn how you can disable sharing of information on Other Integrated Services.

In order to connect to a third party service, you will be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service.

Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
