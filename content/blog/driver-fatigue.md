Fatigue.

It is something we have all experienced at some point in our lives. 

And whether you have experienced it a lot or a little you will remember how it made you feel. 

Drowsy

Lethargic

Easily distracted

Sluggish

Unable to concentrate

Really the list could go on. 

And while minimising fatigue should be made a priority in all of our lives simply for the health benefits. Minimising fatigue in Commerical Drivers who operate on New Zealand roads will save lives. 

The NZ Ministry of Transport has stated on their website that "research shows that the longer people spend driving without a break, the greater their level of fatigue. Also, the time spent in other activities such as work, school, and so on, can increase fatigue and affect subsequent driving."

However, it is also important to note that additional research shows that fatigue is difficult to identify and recognise as having a role in a crash (Williamson and Chamberlain, 2005). So the contribution of fatigue to crashes may be under-represented in the police-reported crash system used in New Zealand.

Even still in 2018 fatigue was a factor in:

23 Fatal Accidents

101 Serious Injury Crashes

556 Minor Injury Crashes

Resulting in:

28 deaths

139 serious injuries

743 minor injuries

That's 910 lives that were adversely affected in 2018 because a driver made the decision to drive while fatigued.
