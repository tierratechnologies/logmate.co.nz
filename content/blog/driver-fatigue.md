I want to give you two scenarios that a lot of people in New Zealand would have experienced. 

First, imagine this. You head to the bar after work with your colleagues and accidentally have a few too many wines. What do you do? Get in your car and drive home, or call an Uber? For most of us, that's a no-brainer. We leave the car behind and catch the Uber, a) because drink driving is illegal with severe legal consequences and b) you could get in an accident. 

Well, how about scenario two. Your toddler has decided to be nocturnal and is trying to strong-arm everyone else in your household to follow suit. One one particular night your darling child didn't even let you get 10min of solid sleep, you reluctantly pull yourself to work the next morning and struggle your way through the day. It hits 5 pm and its time to go home. At this point, you've not actually slept for 36 hours. Do you get in your car and still drive home? Unfortunately, the answer is probably yes. 

While these two scenarios are seemingly very different, the outcomes of the choice to get behind the wheel are scarily similar. In this story I want to talk about the massive impact driving fatigued can have on our national road safety and what should be done about it.

## Fatigue.

It is something we have all experienced at some point in our lives.

And whether you have experienced it a lot or a little you will remember how it made you feel.

Drowsy

Lethargic

Easily distracted

Sluggish

Unable to concentrate

Really the list could go on.

But the surprising reality is, it is not often that someone makes the decision to not get behind the wheel because they are feeling fatigued. 

Minimising fatigue should be made a priority in all of our lives simply for the health benefits. However, minimising fatigue of those driving on New Zealand roads will save lives.

### In 2018 fatigue was a factor in:

23 Fatal Accidents

101 Serious Injury Crashes

556 Minor Injury Crashes

Resulting in:

28 deaths (7% of all deaths)

139 serious injuries

743 minor injuries

That's 910 lives that were adversely affected in 2018 because a driver made the decision to drive while fatigued.

However, it is also important to note that research shows fatigue is difficult to identify and recognise as having a role in a crash (Williamson and Chamberlain, 2005). So the contribution of fatigue to crashes may be under-represented in the police-reported crash system used in New Zealand.

Fatigued Driving Is Drunk Driving

The American National Sleep Foundation has reported that bring awake for 18 hours and driving is the equivalent of driving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.05. And extending that out to 24 hours of no sleep results in the equivalent impairment of a BAC of 0.10. 

In New Zealand, the current legal BAC limit for operating a motor vehicle is 0.05 for people ages 20 and older and a zero-tolerance for those under 20 years of age. 

In terms of infringements if someone is found to be driving with a BAC between 0.051 and 0.08 they can be fined up to $700 and receive 50 demerit points on their licence. Even worse if they are found to have a BAC over 0.08 they could face a criminal conviction.
