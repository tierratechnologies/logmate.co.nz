# The Work-Time Rule Exceptions That Put Road Users At Risk

While there are no restrictions in place to prevent the general public from driving fatigued like there is for drink driving, there is for commercial drivers. However, not every commercial driver in New Zealand has to follow these rules.

The New Zealand work time and logbook requirements were updated in 2017 and are designed to minimise the risk of fatigue for commercial drivers. If you don't already know the standard work time rules are as follows:

* After 5.5 hours of being "on-duty," a 30min rest-break is required
* A "cumulative work day" can have a maximum of 13 hours of work (on-duty) time and must include a continuous 10-hour rest break. This has to be completed within a 24 hour period.
* A "cumulative work period" is the sum of all the work (on-duty) time completed between two continuous 24 hour rest periods and can be no longer than 70 hours total.

These seem quite simple. And while they may not have evolved as research around driver fatigue has evolved they still set out clear expectations for commercial drivers to minimise the risk they pose to other road users.

However, unfortunately, it is not that simple. There are 2 exceptions to these work time requirements that increase the risk to other road users. These apply to Small Passenger Service Drivers and Local Light Vehicle Goods Delivery Drivers.

### Small Passenger Service Industry

In 2017 with the continued presence of the rideshare industry in New Zealand there was a push to standardised legal requirements across the entire small passenger service industry. This includes taxis, rideshares, shuttles, charters etc.

However, with the introduction of the new work-time rules, a Small Passenger Service exemption was included. This meant that:

* Small passenger service drivers can work for 7 hours of continuous work time and then take a 30min rest, provided they have only undertaken short fares around a city or town.
* A short fare means a single fare where the distance between pick-up and drop-off is less than 100km.
* This exemption was included because it was assumed that Small Passenger Service Drivers a likely to have short periods of downtime in-between fares.

Unfortunately, the industry has evolved very quickly and the reason for the exemption is probably now the exception and not the standard experience.

With the introduction of new rideshare companies to New Zealand and the increase of demand from the New Zealand public, drivers are more often than not accepting their next fare before dropping off their first one. For some drivers, they are doing this through a single rideshare company. However, for others, they are running operating for several different rideshare companies at the same time.

### Light Vehicle Goods Delivery

The second relevant exemption is for the light vehicle good delivery industry (ie, courier drivers). 

* A driver of a goods vehicle does not have to maintain a logbook if the vehicle requires a class 1 or 2 licences to be driven and is operated only within a 50km radius of the vehicle operatorâ€™s usual business location or is driven within a 50km radius from a base of operations. 
* The base of operations means a site office established for at least 24 hours or a local depot to which drivers report daily for assignment of tasks or to commence driving.

### So What's The Difference?

I have been having a tough time understanding why courier drivers in New Zealand that are completing short trips don't have to follow the work time laws when passenger service drivers do. Because when you think about it, the actions of the driver are no different, simply their cargo changes.

A passenger service driver is picking up and dropping off people from one location to another, whereas a courier driver is picking up packages.

I suppose there is an added risk to the passengers within that vehicle if a passenger service driver is operating in a fatigued state. They are trusting the driver is operating in a safe manner and that they will get them from point A to point B safely. And the driver is taking on passengers knowing that their safety is his priority.

> But what about other road users, cyclists or pedestrians. They are trusting that anyone who is operating a motor vehicle is doing so in a safe manner, especially those that are driving as part of their employment. When a cyclist gets knocked off their bike, does it matter what type of driver was behind the wheel and what their cargo was?

No where does the affects of fatigue change by the type of "cargo" you have in your vehicle. A driver, regardless of the contents of their vehicle poses the same risk to other road users if they are driving in a fatigued state.

### What Is The Impact?

If you want to learn more about fatigue check out our post ["The Not So Silent Killer on New Zealand Roads"](https://logmate.co.nz/blog/the-not-so-silent-killer-on-nz-roads/). There we highlight the effects of driving while fatigued compared to driving with other impairments and some suggestions on how we can improve.

During the Covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand, we have seen countless news stories of how courier drivers are run off their feet, seeing volumes of deliveries greater than what we normally see during the Christmas holiday period. Unfortunately, this is nothing new. In an article published on [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/104705738/long-days-no-annual-leave-no-breaks--courier-drivers-reveal-difficulties-of-job) in 2018, it was shown that "fourteen-hour days with no break was the new norm for courier drivers".

[Research has shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437514000048) that after 2 hours of continuous driving subjective fatigue and driving performance measures begin to deteriorate and after 4 hours, this turns into a significant adverse effect on both measures. However, only 15 minutes of rest provides enough time to recover from 2 hours of continuous driving with the rest needed doubling to 30min for 4 hours to continuous driving. The NZ Ministry of Transport even backs up these findings publishing on their website that "research shows the longer people spend driving without a break, the greater their level of fatigue. Also, the time spent in other activities such as work, school, and so on, can increase fatigue and affect subsequent driving."

> So why can SPS drivers operate for 7 hours straight and courier drivers have no restrictions?

### But Short-Haul Light Goods Vehicles Aren't The Same A Long-Haul Heavy Goods Vehicles, Right?

It is a [common misconception](https://www.tac.vic.gov.au/road-safety/safe-driving/tips-and-tools/fighting-fatigue) that fatigue is only a problem for long-distance drivers; however, this is not the case. Fatigue is as problematic for short-haul light as long-haul heavy transport drivers. Short-haul light drivers have reported working long day time hours with too few rest breaks and high exposure to an urban traffic environment in an uncomfortable vehicle, which causes fatigue to manifest in impaired negotiation of urban driving environments.

Generally, it is not driving alone that causes fatigue but rather several contributing factors often prior to the driver even getting behind the wheel. These can include, shift work, lack of sleep, lack of exercise, over-exercise, medication and long hours just to name a few. And the reality is we can't fight our bodies need to sleep forever. Eventually, the chemicals within your brain will overcome your conscious thoughts and your body will fall asleep, even if just for a few seconds, something called Microsleeps. 

Microsleeps are short bursts of sleep, often experienced without the person even being aware they took place ([tuck.com](https://www.tuck.com/microsleep/)). During this time (which can last anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes) a driver will not be able to respond to an external stimulus such as crossing the centre line, an upcoming turn or traffic lights. 

> Microsleep episodes do not discriminate based on the type of work a driver is undertaking or what their cargo is. So why do our work-time rules?

### What Can We Do?

We need to recognise that all commercial driving is exposed to the same risks associated with fatigue. Fatigue can occur long before someone gets behind the wheel of a vehicle. Furthermore, the type of vehicle and/or the type of work being completed has little effect on the level of fatigue it can impart on a driver. 

The exceptions included for the Small Passenger Service and Light Short-Haul Goods Delivery Industries don't accurately reflect the type of work (or the hours of work) that are being done by drivers. Continuing to allow these exceptions not only puts the drivers at risk but also all other NZ road users.
