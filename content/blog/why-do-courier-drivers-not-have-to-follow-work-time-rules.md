title = "Why Do Courier Drivers Not Have To Follow Work-Time Rules?"

+++
While there are no restrictions in place to prevent the general public from driving fatigued like there is for drink driving, there is for commercial drivers. However, not every commercial driver in New Zealand has to follow these rules.

I have been having a tough time understanding why courier drivers in New Zealand that are completing short trips don't have to follow the work time laws. However, passenger service drivers do. Because when you think. about it the actions of the driver are no different. Its just the cargo that they are carrying changes.

A passenger service driver is picking up and dropping off people from one location to another. A courier drivers is picking up a package or letter in one location and dropping it off in another.

I suppose there is an added risk to the passengers within that vehicle if a passenger service driver is operating in a fatigued state. They are trusting the driver is operating in a safe manner and that they will get them from point A to point B safely. And the driver is taking on passengers knowing that their safety is his priority.

But what about other road users, cyclists or pedesterians. They are trusting that anyone who is operating a motor vehicle is doing so in a safe manner, especially those that are driving as part of their employment.

To a cyclists it doesn't matter if the person who knocked them of their bike was a rideshare driver or a courier driver. It makes not difference in the world to them.

If a driver is fatigued it has been shown that they can have "micro sleeps" behind the wheel. Meaning they could be closing their eyes for anywhere between 3-5 seconds. If they were driving on a motorway at 100km per hour they could travel the length of a rugby field in that time.

No where does the affects of fatigue change by the type of "cargo" you have in your vehicle. A driver, regardless of the contents of their vehicle poses the same risk to other road users if they are driving in a fatigued state.

During the Covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand we have seen countless news stories of how courier drivers are run off their feet and are seeing volumes of deliveries greater than what we normally see during the Christmas holiday period.

And we already know that courier drivers have been under immense pressure for a long time with one [Stuff article](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/104705738/long-days-no-annual-leave-no-breaks--courier-drivers-reveal-difficulties-of-job) stating that "fourteen-hour days with no break was the new norm for courier drivers" back in 2018.

Fatigue In Commerical Drivers

Commercial drivers operate vehicles on New Zealand roads for a living. If you are a full time commercial driver you will understand the amount of time that you spend behind the wheel every day. 

If you aren't imagine this. 

Add up all the time you spend commuting to and from work and the time that you are at work, somewhere between 8 - 12 hours maybe?

Now imagine spending all that time sitting behind the wheel of a vehicle driving. 

[Research has shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437514000048) that after 2 hours of continuous driving subjective fatigue and driving performance measures began to deteriorate. However, after 4 hours of continuous driving, the impact went from deterioration to a significant adverse effect on both measures. However, only 15 minutes of rest was able to provide enough time to recover from 2 hours of continuous driving with the rest needed doubling to 30min for 4 hours to continuous driving. 

The NZ Ministry of Transport has stated on their website that "research shows the longer people spend driving without a break, the greater their level of fatigue. Also, the time spent in other activities such as work, school, and so on, can increase fatigue and affect subsequent driving."
