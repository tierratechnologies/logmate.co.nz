### Purpose Of A Logbook

In New Zealand, a logbook provides a method for commercial drivers in the transportation industry to record their work and rest time to stay compliant and legal. Regardless of which type of logbook is being used a driver needs to be able to show an enforcement officer that they are complying with the NZ work-times rules and provide copies of their logbook to the administrator of the Transport Service Licence (TSL) they are driving under.

### What Type Of Logbooks Are There?

There are two types of NZTA Approved logbooks in New Zealand for recording work time compliance:

* Paper Logbooks
* Electronic Logbooks

The Logmate Digital Logbook is [one of seven NZTA Approved electronic logbooks](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/commercial-driving/commercial-safety/work-time-and-logbook-requirements/electronic-driver-logbooks/).

### What Information Has To Be Recorded?

No matter which logbook you have there is specific information that needs to be recorded. All NZTA approved logbooks will allow you to record these minimum requirements.

The information required includes:

* driver name (initials and surname, or first and last name)
* the date of the shift
* the time the shift starts and finishes
* the registration number of each vehicle driven
* the start and finish distance recorder readings (if the vehicle is subject to road user charges)
* the start and finish times and location for all work-time and rest time

### Does This Information Get Shared With Anyone?

The information recorded in your logbook also has some requirements around how it is shared. As a driver, you are required to:

* supply copies of your logbook to any Transport Service Licence (TSL) Holder that you operate under within 14 days of recording the shift.
* if requested by an enforcement officer have available immediately all logbook shifts recorded since your previous 24-hour continuous rest break
* keep copies of your logbook records for at least 12months after the shift was recorded
* if requested by an enforcement officer be able to provide copies of your logbook from the previous 12 months
