# The Ins And Outs Of The New Zealand Work Time Rules

The New Zealand work time rules for commercial drivers in New Zealand were designed and implemented to manage the risk of fatigue for drivers who are on our roads the most. Furthermore, the requirement of recording work and rest time into an NZTA approved Logbook aids in ensuring all drivers required to do so are following the work time rules. However, we are seeing more and more drivers confused by what these rules are.

In this article, I want to share with you the simple way to understand the work time rules and so you can become a domain knowledge expert. I also want to show how the Logmate Digital Logbook is designed to help you follow these rules to keep you safe on the road and complaint.

## The Work Time Rules & The Logmate Digital Logbook In 8 Easy Steps

### 1. Cumulative Work Day

* Every day that you work is a Cumulative Work Day (CWD) and it is made up of two parts;
  * your work shift (we will talk about this more next)
  * a 10-hour continuous rest break.
* It can only be a maximum of 24 hours which means that the time between when you start your shift and end your shift in your Digital Logbook can be no longer than 14 hours.
* One thing a lot of people don't know is a new CWD starts after your continuous 10-hour rest break is completed. If you were to start a new shift before this 10-hours is finished you would be continuing your previous CWD rather than starting a new one. An easy way to know if you are starting a new CWD is by your dashboard. If it looks like the image on the left you will be starting a new CWD, if it looks like the one on the right you'll be continuing your previous CWD.

### 2. A Shift

"Shift" is the terminology we use in the Logmate Digital Logbook, and is the same as what the NZTA described as your "working window". It is designed to represent all "on-duty time" and breaks less than 10-hours in duration.

* Each CWD should only have one shift
* When you click End Shift you are committing to taking a continuous 10-hour rest break, indicating when you return to work you will be starting a new CWD

### 3. On-Duty Time

You'll see in all the NZTA resources they refer to work-time. This can be a little confusing because it is easy to assume this means any time you aren't working you should be on a break. This isn't quite the case.

At Logmate we prefer to use the term "on-duty" as this is actually more representative of what needs to be logged as work-time in your logbook.

All of the following examples are considered "on-duty" and you should log them as either driving or other work in your logbook:

* Driving
* Available for hire (online on a rideshare driver app)
* Refuelling
* Administration
* Loading & Unloading
* Cleaning & maintenance of a vehicle associated with work
* All other paid employment
* Any break less than 30min in duration

### 4. Taking A Break In Your Logbook

Three things need to all occur in order for you to record a break in your logbook.

1. Your not "on-duty"
2. Must be a minimum of 30min in duration
3. Not spent in a moving vehicle related to work

Essentially, if you return to "on-duty" in your logbook prior to completing your 30min continuous rest break (for example return to work after 17minutes) that time will be added to your "on-duty" time.

A 30min break is required after a maximum of 5.5 hours of "on-duty" time (or 7 hours if you are purely operating under a Small Passenger Service Licence).

### 5. Cumulative Work Period

People often get really confused with the Cumulative Work Period believing that it is represented by a calendar week (Monday to Sunday). However, this is not the case! Rather it is a collection of CWDs that

* begins after a continuous 24-hour rest break and, 
* can only be a maximum of 70 total hours of on-duty time. 

So a cumulative work period could anywhere from 1 day through to 10 days or more. 

The 24-hours continuous rest break is calculated by looking back at the end time of your most recent shift and the time when you are starting a new shift and looking at the duration. 

For Example: if you ended at a shift at 6:30am on a Saturday and started your next shift at 10:00am on Sunday the duration between these two times is 27 hours and 30min. This would mean a new Cumulative Work Period would begin. 

### 6. Calculating The Countdown Timer

The countdown timer in the Logmate Digital Logbook is an extremely useful tool to be able to stay on top of when you need to change between on and off duty. However, we have had some questions about how the countdown timer calculates its durations. 

1. Each work state (on duty or rest time) has its designated maximum or minimum duration set out in the work-time rules.
2. When you change your work state the logbook looks at what this new work state and what is required duration is and displays this in the form of a countdown timer. 

##### Example

* You start a drive shift with a vehicle whose type is Small Passenger Service. The countdown timer will display 6 hours 59 min of "on-duty" time remaining. 
* After 4 hours you decide to take a break (when the timer says 2 hours 59 minutes). After clicking on break and returning to the dashboard your countdown time will display 29 minutes. The amount of time required to record it as a break. 
* During your break, you actually decide you are finished work for the day and won't work again until tomorrow. However, you forget to click End Shift in your logbook. After 1 hour and 15 minutes you remember and open back up your logbook and click End Shift.
* After Locking the shift and returning to the dashboard you will see your countdown timer says 8 hours and 45minutes. This is because the 1 hour 15min break taken at the end of your shift is counted towards your 10-hour continuous rest-break. 

### 7. Seeing Your Balances

Along the top of your Logmate Digital Logbook, you will be able to see two circles (as shown in the image below). 

1. The left-hand circle represents your Cumulative Work Period. This total will continue to increase adding together all your "on-duty" time until a 24-hour continuous rest break is taken. 
2. The right-hand circle represents your Shift. This is the duration for the time you started your current active shift and will reset after you end & lock your shift and wait 10 hours before starting a new shift  (and CWD)
