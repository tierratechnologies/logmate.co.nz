# The Ins And Outs Of The New Zealand Work Time Rules

As a commercial driver in New Zealand, you will already know that you have to follow the NZ Work Time Rules and record your work/rest time in a logbook. However, this doesn't mean it is easy to understand.

In this article, I want to share with you the simple ways to understand the work time rules and how the Logmate Digital Logmate can help.

## The Work Time Rules & The Logmate Digital Logbook In 6 Easy Steps

### 1. Cumulative Work Day

The NZTA refers to a Cumulative Work Day in the legislation but personally I think that's confusing; so we are going to just call it your Work Day!

* Your Work Day includes a single Work Shift which can be a maximum of 14 hours in duration; from start to finish.
* You need to take at least 10 hours off after you finish a Work Shift in order to start a new one. Anything less than 10 hours will continue your previous Work Shift.
* The combination of your Work Shift and the 10-hour continuous break that follows it is your Work Day.
* If your Work Day 

### 2. A Work Shift

In your Logmate Digital Logbook, you will have a Start Shift button and End Shift button. The time between these two entries represents your Work Shift.

Your work shift will include both on-duty time and rest breaks less 

* Each Work Day should only have one Work Shift
* When you click End Shift you are committing to taking a continuous 10-hour rest break, indicating when you return to work you will be starting a new Work Day.

### 3. On-Duty Time

All of the following examples are considered "on-duty" and you should log them as either driving or other work in your logbook:

* Driving
* Available for hire (online on a rideshare driver app)
* Refuelling
* Administration
* Loading & Unloading
* Cleaning & maintenance of a vehicle associated with work
* All other paid employment
* Any break less than 30min in duration

### 4. Taking A Break In Your Logbook

There are three types of breaks that you will record in your Digital Logbook:

1. Minimum 30min breaks during your Work Shift
2. Minimum 10-hour break to start a new Work Day
3. Minimum 24-hour break to start a new Work Period

In order to record a break during your Work Shift, you simply need to click the Take Break button in your logbook. A 30min break is required after a maximum of 5.5 hours of "on-duty" time (or 7 hours if you are purely operating under a Small Passenger Service Licence).

**_Note:_** I_f you return to "on-duty" in your logbook prior to completing your 30min continuous rest break (for example return to work after 17minutes) that time will be added to your "on-duty" time._

The other two breaks are calculated based on the duration of time since your previous Work Shift ended. You do not need to do anything to record this break, it is done for you.

### 5. Cumulative Work Period

People often get really confused with the Cumulative Work Period believing that it is represented by a calendar week (Monday to Sunday). However, this is not the case! Rather it is a collection of Work Days and:

* begins after a continuous 24-hour rest break and,
* can only be a maximum of 70 total hours of on-duty time.

So a cumulative work period could anywhere from 1 day through to 10 days or more.

### 6. Seeing Your Balances

Along the top of your Logmate Digital Logbook, you will be able to see two circles (as shown in the image below).

1. The left-hand circle represents your Cumulative Work Period. This total will continue to increase adding together all your "on-duty" time until a 24-hour continuous rest break is taken.
2. The right-hand circle represents your Shift. This is the duration for the time you started your current active shift and will reset after you end & lock your shift and wait 10 hours before starting a new shift  (and CWD)
