# The Ins And Outs Of The New Zealand Work Time Rules

The New Zealand work time rules for commercial drivers in New Zealand were designed and implemented to manage the risk of fatigue for drivers who are on our roads the most. Furthermore, the requirement of recording work and rest time into an NZTA approved Logbook aids in ensuring all drivers required to do so are following the work time rules. However, we are seeing more and more drivers confused by what the work-time rules are. 

In this article I want to share with you the simple way to understand the work time rules and so you can become a domain knowledge expert. I also want to show how the Logmate Digital Logbook is designed to help you follow these rules to keep you safe on the road and complaint. 

The Work Time Rules & The Logmate Digital Logbook In 8 Easy Steps

### Cumulative Work Day 

A cumulative workday begins after a continuous 10-hour rest break. It must be no longer than 24 hours and include a 10-hour continuous rest break. This means your "On-Duty" time must take place within a 14-hour working window (shift). 

### Shift In Your Logbook 

A shift in the Logmate Digital Logbook equates to your working-window mentioned above. This means that it can consist of both on-duty time and all rest-time less than a continuous 10-hour duration. Just like the working window you can only have one "shift" during your Cumulative workday. So when you start work for the day click Start Shift and only End Your Shift when you are able to commit to your 10-hour continuous rest break.

### On-Duty Time

You'll see in all the NZTA resources they refer to work-time. This can be a little confusing because it is easy to assume this means any time you aren't working you should be on a break. This isn't quite the case. At Logmate we prefer to use the term "on-duty" as this is actually more representative of what needs to be logged at work-time in your logbook. This means if you are available to work (ie logged into a rideshare facilitators app) you need to be in an active drive record in your logbook. 

### Taking A Break In Your Logbook

Three things need to all occur in order for you to record a break in your logbook. 

1. Your not "on-duty"
2. Must be a minimum of 30min in duration
3. Not spent in a moving vehicle related to work

Essentially, if you return to "on-duty" in your logbook prior to completing your 30min continuous rest break (for example return to work after 17minutes) that time will be added to your "on-duty" time.
