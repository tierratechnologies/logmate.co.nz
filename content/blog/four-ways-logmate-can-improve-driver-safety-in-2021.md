# Four Ways Logmate Can Improve Driver Safety In 2021

Logmate has been working on improving Driver Safety since 2014 through our Digital Logbook. To kick off 2021 we wanted to highlight the four main areas where Logmate can improve Driver safety through the tools available for both Operators and Drivers. 

1. Visibility
2. Accountability
3. Accuracy
4. Simplicity

#### Visibility of Work Time Records

From within the dedicated Operator Admin Portal, Transport Operators can have real time visibility of their Drivers work time balance. When a Driver makes an entry in their Digital Logbook via the Logmate App (on either iOS or Android) this information is pushed back to their linked Transport Operators giving them insight into how much work time the Driver still has available or if they are due for their rest break. 

  
This level of visibility means an Operator can be up-to date and informed with all their Drivers work-time status in order to get them back home safely at the end of the day.

#### Real Time Accountability

The visibility provided to Transport Operators in real-time also helps keeps drivers accountable for their actions. Drivers are aware that their Operators get updated in real-time. 

#### Accuracy Of Entries

We all know that mistakes happen. 

#### Easy and Simple To Use
