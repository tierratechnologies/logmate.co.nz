# Invest In All Your Work Tools; Including Your Device

### Your work tools require investment and upkeep; your device is no different.

As most people are aware the world of technology moves at a fairly rapid pace. This is one of the major benefits of technology but it does also come with challenges. One of those being if you don't keep up with the change sometimes you can get left behind. We want to provide you with the information you need to make sure you are able to continue enjoying the benefits of the Logmate Digital Logbook.

***

#### The Logmate Digital Logbook App

We consider ourselves an actively managed app. This means that our development team is continually working in the background to improve the Logmate Digital Logbook App and its functions. This includes making changes that are required, fixing any bugs that crop up quickly to minimise interruptions to service and introducing new features and functionality to continue to be the best Digital Logbook available in New Zealand.

As we continue to develop the Logmate App to perform at its best and provide all the tools you require as a commercial driver, new versions of the Logmate Digital Logbook App will be released. And as each new App Version is released newer technology (both hardware and software) is going to be required from you as a user.

#### Investing In Your Work Tools

As a commercial driver, you have several "work-tools" that help you be successful and safe in your profession. This can include:

* Yourself (professionalism, clothing, personal care etc)
* Your vehicle
* Your website/marketing material
* Your compliance tools
* Your work facilitation tools

Each of these areas has a profound impact on how you operate as a commercial driver. Let's take your vehicle for an example.

###### Investing In Your Vehicle

As a commercial driver, your vehicle can be your pride and joy. Not only does the upkeep of the vehicle show your professionalism but it also becomes a reliable resource that you can count on to earn an income. If your vehicle isn't available to use, then you aren't earning money. It's as simple as that. So what do you do to ensure your vehicle is up to scratch:

* You research makes and models and purchase a vehicle that is safe and reliable
* You do self-vehicle checks and inspections to ensure you stay on top of any issues that may crop up
* You schedule regular services and maintenance to keep it running smoothly and issue free
* You keep it up to a high standard so that is will pass its Warrant/Certificate of Fitness with flying colours

The reward for putting the investment (both time and money) into your vehicle? Knowing that it is safe to operate and it will be available for you to earn money more often and not sitting at the mechanics costing you money.

###### Is Your Mobile Device Any Different?

When you make the decision to use a Digital Logbook like Logmate to manage your compliance requirements you make the decision to prioritise your mobile device as a work tool. You may argue that it is not as important as your vehicle; however, I would have to disagree. Because what use is a great vehicle when you can't maintain your legal compliance requirements to operate it.

As with vehicles, every year there will be new models of mobile devices and new versions of operating systems that they run on. What you may not be as aware of is that backend technology continues to evolve as well, something that we at Logmate are also at the mercy of. So we have prioritised using newer technologies so that we can stay ahead of the curve and ensure our users will always have the best experience. This also means Logmate users will need to move with us. 

If you have decided to use a digital logbook then investing in your mobile device is just as important as investing in your vehicle. 

#### So What Can You Do?

Now investing in your mobile device does not mean you have to go out and purchase the most recent, top of the line mobile device. It just means making sure we invest your money into a device that will cater to your needs to a significant amount of time. Mobile devices are no longer very expensive and the price difference between nearly out of date models and basic up-to-date models is minimal. So we suggest you do the following:

1. Ensure your current device is capable of updating its operating system as newer versions come out.
   1. The most recent versions are Android 10 and iOS 13 respectively 
2. If purchasing a new device ensure it is one that is capable of staying up-to-date with newer operating systems
3. Always download the newest Operating System update as soon as it becomes available
4. Be aware of when your device may be becoming out-dated and schedule for when you may need to purchase a new one

By following all these steps you can ensure you are never caught out by technology moving forward and you being left behind. Remember, that improvements in technology is a really good thing. It allows us to continue to bring you new products and features that are suggested by our users.
