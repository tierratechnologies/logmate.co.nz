# Invest In All Your Work Tools; Including Your Device

### All your work tools require investment and upkeep; your device is no different.

As most people are aware the world of technology moves at a fairly rapid pace. This is one of the major benefits of technology but it does also come with its challenges. One of those being if you don't keep up with the change sometimes you can get left behind. We want to provide you with the information to make sure you are able to continue enjoying the benefits of the Logmate Digital Logbook. 

#### The Logmate Digital Logbook App

We consider ourselves an actively managed app. This means that our development team is continually working in the background to improve the Logmate Digital Logbook App and its functions. This includes making changes that are required, fixing any bugs that crop up quickly to minimise interruptions to service and introducing new features and functionality to continue to be the best Digital Logbook available in New Zealand. 

As we continue to develop the Logmate App to perform at its best and provide all the tools you require as a commercial driver, new versions of the Logmate Digital Logbook App will be released. And as each new App Version is released newer technology (both hardware and software) is going to be required from you as a user. 

#### Investing In Your Work Tools

As a commercial driver, you have several "work-tools" that help you be successful and safe in your profession. This can include:

* Yourself (professionalism, clothing, personal care etc)
* Your vehicle
* Your website/marketing material
* Your compliance tools
* Your work facilitation tools

Each of these areas has a profound impact on how you operate as a commercial driver. Let's take your vehicle for an example.

###### Investing In Your Vehicle

Often times as a commercial driver your vehicle is your pride and joy. Not only does the upkeep of the vehicle show your professionalism but it also becomes a reliable resource that you can count on to earn an income. If your vehicle isn't available to use, then you aren't earning money. It's as simple as that. So what do you do to ensure your vehicle is up to scratch:

* You research makes and models and purchase a vehicle that is safe and reliable
* You do self-vehicle checks and inspections to ensure you stay on top of any issues that may crop up
* You schedule regular services and maintenance to keep it running smoothly and issue free
* You keep it up to a high standard so that is will pass its Warrant/Certificate of Fitness with flying colours

The reward for putting the investment (both time and money) into your vehicle? Knowing that it is safe to operate and it will be available to you to earn money more often and not sitting at the mechanics costing you money. 

###### Is Your Mobile Device Any Different?

You may argue that your mobile device is not as integral to your operations as a commercial driver than your vehicle, but I would have to disagree. Because what use is a great vehicle when you can't maintain your legal compliance requirements. Deciding to use a Digital Logbook marks a big step towards the future of compliance requirements in the Transportation Industry. You should take pride in the decision to be a part of the future before everyone is required to make the change. However, this does come with some investment. 

Just like making sure your vehicle is up to the task of performing at a high level, your mobile device needs to do the same. As we continue to push out new updates of our Digital Logbook App and Platform the requirements from the Operating System on your device is going to change.
