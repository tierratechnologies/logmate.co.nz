## How To Record Work-time For Rideshare And Non-driving Employment

We have seen an increasing number of Ride-share drivers in New Zealand who are driving as a side gig alongside other non-driving employment. Additionally, our Customer Support team have noticed more and more drivers are confused about what work needs to be recorded in their work-time logbook and how to record it. 

In this post I want to clarify what work-time needs to be recorded in your logbook, how to record it correctly and why it is important.

### What Needs To Be Recorded

When we are figuring out what needs to be recorded as work-time we need to look at what work is being done in the current cumulative work period. 

A **cumulative work period (CWP)** is defined as the period of time between two continuous 24 hours rest breaks. 

If you are **doing ANY Ride-share driving in your CWP you are required to also record ALL other employment in your logbook**, regardless of the type of work being done. 

In addition to this, your other work has to follow the 5.5 hour rest time requirements. 

**For example:** 

* You work an office job Monday to Friday 8:00am to 5:00pm
* Every week you do Ride-share work on a Friday and Saturday night
* You will need to record all work time for both your office job and your ridesharing. 
* You will need to take a continuous 30min break at your office job between 11:00am and 1:30pm
* You will have to end your Ride-sharing work by 8am on Sunday in order to restart your cumulative work period at 8am Monday.
* If your car goes to the mechanic and one week you don't do any Ride-share driving then you won't need to record your office job work hours that week

##### In summary, if you are driving ride-share in you CWP you have to record ALL WORK-TIME in your logbook, if you aren't driving ride-share in your CWP you don't have to record any work-time in your logbook. 

### How To Record All Work-Time In Logmate

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2020-02-21-at-11-35-31-am.png)Logmate makes it really easy to record all work-time in your logbook. When you start your shift you will have the option to record one of two types of work:

1. Driving
2. Other Duty

Only the Drive entry will require a vehicle record to be selected. If you select other duties then a vehicle record isn't necessary. If you are driving ride-share (and your vehicle record is set-up correctly for this) then you will see your full 7 hour driving allowance. However, when selecting other duties you will only get 5.5 hours of work-time before needing a 30min break. 

Other Duties encompasses all types of work that isn't driving. For example:

* Duties relating to operating your vehicles which isn't driving
* Administration relating to being a sole trader
* All other paid employment regardless of if it is in the transportation industry

### Why It Is Important?

1. **It's the law.** 

   The following comes from the [Land Transport Rule: Work Time and Logbooks 2007](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/rules/docs/work-time-and-logbooks-2007-as-at-1-October-2017.pdf).

2. **Prevent fatigue related accidents on our roads.** 

   In 2019 [36 deaths in road accidents](https://www.transport.govt.nz/statistics-and-insights/safety-annual-statistics/) were attributed to driver fatigue on New Zealand roads. That is 36 peoples lives that ended because a person operating a motor vehicle was driving in a fatigued state. Anything we can do in the transportation industry to minimise this statistic is extremely vital. That is why is is important to remember that all types of work contribute to a cumulative fatigue affect which can only be reduced by rest.
