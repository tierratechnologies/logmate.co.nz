## Preventing Fatigue While Driving Is More Than Just Managing Your Work Time

A lot of focus is often put on hours behind the wheel as the number one contribution to driver fatigue. While here at Logmate we provide tools for drivers to manage their work and rest time we want drivers to know that there are also lots of other things they need to keep in mind when minimising their risk of Driver Fatigue. 

Think of a drivers work-time allowance like the speed limit. Sure on the motorway, you can legally drive at 100km/h. However, if you found yourself in a sudden downpour or the roads were icy would you keep going at that speed? My guess is no, you would most likely reduce your speed to stay safe, given the conditions. 

Driver work-time allowances are the same. Just because a driver can legally work up to 13 hours in a day doesn't mean they should if they know they are fatigued. Driving fatigued not only puts the driver at risk but also any passengers they have or other road users. 

However, we continue to see drivers making more risky choices with their decision to driver mostly due to the fact that their income is directly related to their hours on the road. 

So in the post, we are going to talk about some strategies to reduce driver fatigue so that you can safely maximise your driving hours.

Stay Hydrated

Do Some Light Exercise
