## Preventing Fatigue While Driving Is More Than Just Managing Your Work Time

A lot of focus is often put on hours behind the wheel as the number one contribution to driver fatigue. While here at Logmate we provide tools for drivers to manage their work and rest time we want drivers to know that there are also lots of other things they need to keep in mind when minimising their risk of Driver Fatigue.

Think of the driver work-time allowance like the speed limit. Sure on the motorway, you can legally drive at 100km/h. However, if you found yourself in a sudden downpour or the roads were icy would you keep going at that speed? My guess is no, you would most likely reduce your speed to stay safe, given the conditions.

**Driver work-time allowances are the same.** 

Just because a driver can legally work up to 13 hours in a day doesn't mean they should if they know they are fatigued. Driving fatigued not only puts the driver at risk but also any passengers they have or other road users.

However, we continue to see drivers making more risky choices with their decision to drive mostly due to the fact that their income is directly related to their hours on the road.

So in the post, we are going to talk about some strategies to reduce driver fatigue so that you can safely maximise your driving hours.

#### Stay Hydrated

Hydration is my number one tip to preventing the onset of fatigue. Water plays a vital role in making sure essential nutrients are transported to cells in your body and removing waste products. Since we lose water through sweat, urine and even just breathing we need to make sure we are replacing it adequately. Even the smallest amount of water loss can start to make you feel sluggish. 

So how much water do you need to drink? The [Mayo Clinic]() has reported that men should consume 3.7 litres per day whereas women only need 2.7 litres. Interestingly 20% of this can come from water-rich fruit and vegetables. 

So make sure you have a water bottle handy in your vehicle and sip on it throughout the day to make sure you are staying hydrated and energised. 

#### Light Exercise

While heavy exercise can contribute to feeling fatigued light exercise can actually help prevent it. In fact, a study by the [University of Georgia](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080228112008.htm) found that:

#### Get A Good Nights Sleep

#### Make Good Food Choices

What we put in our mouths has a huge impact on the state of our body and mind. Foods that are high in sugar can cause massive fluctuations in blood sugar. While you may feel energised for a period of time (while your blood sugar is high) you will quickly turn to feel lethargic and sluggish.
