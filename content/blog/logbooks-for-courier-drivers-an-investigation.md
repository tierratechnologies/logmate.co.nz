# Logbooks For Courier Drivers: An Investigation

### Life As A Courier Driver

There has always been a narrative in New Zealand that Courier Drivers work extremely long hours. Every year around Christmas you start to hear the stories in main stream media about the exponential increase in parcels being sent and requiring more couriers to be on the road for longer hours. But as quickly as these stories reach our eyes and ears they disappear again waiting for next year. 

However, 2020 has been different. The Covid-19 Pandemic forced us into our homes and unable to shop and interact as we normally would. We had already been seeing a rise in online shopping in a range of industries, but lockdown put this into over-drive ([https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/122349826/online-shopping-emerges-as-the-big-winner-in-the-first-six-months-of-2020](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/122349826/online-shopping-emerges-as-the-big-winner-in-the-first-six-months-of-2020 "https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/122349826/online-shopping-emerges-as-the-big-winner-in-the-first-six-months-of-2020")). 

The follow on affect from this was the increased work load on courier and delivery drivers in New Zealand to levels we had never seen before ([https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-huge-backlog-of-level-3-packages-to-start-moving-soon/WBUFJCLKI3MO3DHX3PR22554NM/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-huge-backlog-of-level-3-packages-to-start-moving-soon/WBUFJCLKI3MO3DHX3PR22554NM/ "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-huge-backlog-of-level-3-packages-to-start-moving-soon/WBUFJCLKI3MO3DHX3PR22554NM/"))

Recently a courier driver who works for NZ Couriers told RNZ she was arriving at her depot at 4.15am to start loading up and was not finishing until 6pm most days. ([https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300013869/nz-couriers-claim-drivers-covid19-wage-subsidy-theyre-rorting-everyone](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300013869/nz-couriers-claim-drivers-covid19-wage-subsidy-theyre-rorting-everyone "https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300013869/nz-couriers-claim-drivers-covid19-wage-subsidy-theyre-rorting-everyone"))

Careers.govt.nz even backs up what is occurring in the industry stating on their website that the "working conditions" of a Courier/Deliver driver is sometimes working up to 84 hours in a week [https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/transport-and-logistics/transport-logistics/courier-delivery-agent/](https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/transport-and-logistics/transport-logistics/courier-delivery-agent/ "https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/transport-and-logistics/transport-logistics/courier-delivery-agent/")). 

Now if you are anything like me, you might start to think... is this safe? Are these Drivers actually capable or safely operating a vehicle when they have worked so many hours?

Current Work-Time Restrictions

Before we continue to look at Courier Drivers I think it is important to look into current safety regulations in New Zealand. 

There are two parts to the Land Transport Act that has significant importance to us. 

Part 4A outlines the Transport Service Licensing process, including who has to obtain a licence and what the process involves. 

Part 4B discusses the Work Time and Logbook requirements for both Drivers and Operators. 

As it stands today Courier Drivers in New Zealand don't keep work-time logbooks or follow the work-time requirements as set out in the Land Transport Act. It is common practice for Drivers to work 8-10 hours without a break and far exceed 70 hours total work before taking a full day (24 hours) off. And the major driving force for this behaviour comes from a claim of an exemption that the industry believed applies to them.

" The subsection does not apply to the driver of a goods vehicle if it is used within a 50 km radius of the vehicleâ€™s normal base of operation"

However, when you look at the wider
