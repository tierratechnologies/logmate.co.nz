# About Tierra Technologies

Founded in late 2012, we set out on a mission to _change_ how Drivers went about keeping a logbook and staying safe.

We are a small, multi-disciplinary team of people, spread out all over the world. Global HQ is Matakana, just north of Auckland.
We have team members in Japan, USA, India and Gulf Harbour.

### Big ambitions

Our aim is to never stop striving to improve what we offer and how we go about it. From the outset, we have always looked
and things in our own way.

Our plans for the platform are immense; we keep focus by tackling things in small chunks. We are getting better at it and
I'm sure all of our loyal customers will attest to the lessons learned and improvements that have been made, particularly recently.

### Our History

Because things don't just happen over night.
            
They do happen though, when you keep working at it...
            
... and we aren't done yet, by any means.
