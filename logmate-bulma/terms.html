            <p>Logmate will make reasonable efforts to keep the Logmate Service operational. However, certain technical
                difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. Logmate reserves
                the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions
                and features of the Logmate Service, with or without notice, all without liability to you for any

            <h2 class="title is-2">Payments and Cancellations</h2>

            <p>If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to Logmate will automatically renew at the end of the
                subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the
                end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of
                the current subscription period. After this you will no longer be able to use Logmate to log your
                work-time. You will however, still have access to your existing work history.</p>

            <p>Logmate may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price
                changes to you. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next
                subscription period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Logmate Service
                after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price.</p>
    
            <br>
            <h2 class="title is-2">Term and Termination</h2>

                terminate the Terms or suspend your access to the Logmate Service at any time, including in the event of
                your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the Logmate Service or non-compliance with the Terms. If
                you or Logmate terminate the Terms, or if Logmate suspends your access to the Logmate Service, you agree
                that Logmate shall have no liability or responsibility to you and Logmate will not refund any amounts
                that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn how to
                terminate your Logmate account, please contact us.</p>

                of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="title is-2">Limitation</h2>

            <p>You agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, your sole and exclusive remedy for any
                problems or dissatisfaction with the Logmate Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party

                Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content.</p>

            <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LOGMATE, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES,
                AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR
                (i) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE,
                DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LOGMATE SERVICE,
                THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD
                TO WHETHER LOGMATE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF
                ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (ii) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE LOGMATE SERVICE, THIRD
                PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO LOGMATE
                DURING THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS IN QUESTION.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="title is-2">Entire Agreement</h2>

            <p>These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Logmate and
                supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or
                oral. Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the
                Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to Logmate are void. You represent that you
                have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by Logmate that
                are not contained in the Agreements.</p>

            <p>Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Logmate Service may be governed by additional
                agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Logmate Community for customer support, or
                free or discounted Trials. You will agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances, which
                are listed in full on our website. Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of
                the
                Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not
                supersede these Agreements. To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and these
                Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="title is-2">Severability</h2>

            <p>Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such
                invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the
                remaining provisions of the Terms, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent
                permitted by law.</p>

            Thank you for reading our Terms. We hope you enjoy Logmate.
